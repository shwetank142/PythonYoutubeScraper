# PythonYoutubeScraper

1) This project is all about extracting the data from youtube Channel Videos and showing in form of table.
2) Data includes :
   Video Title,
   Youtube Videos Url,
   Thumbnails Url (to download images),
   Video ID,
   Likes,
   Views,
   Commenter,
   Comments, 
   Total comments.
3) Apart from that I have used database like MongoDb which will store all the data that has been scraped.
4) I prefered going with mongodb database(NoSQL) and not MySql(SQL) beacuse videos and images can easily be store in NoSql database 
   in the form of chunks and files.
5) It will also download thr videos and images in local system. ( based on your local system Path)
6) The scraped data can further be utilised for Data Analysis and Data Science Activities( model building and predicting the required
   outcome.)
